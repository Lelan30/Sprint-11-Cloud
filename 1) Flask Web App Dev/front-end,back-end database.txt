# Front-End, Back-End Database

# Web applications are built on a relatively thick stack - 
from the client (user with their browser) over a network to 
the back-end (server) and database (for data persistence).

# Front End: a wep-page styles with CSS (Bootstrap), 
listing TODO items 

# Back End: a Flask application that recieves request for returning, 
creating, or completing/deleting TODOS, returns response appropriate 
to front end user

# Database: a PostGreSQL instance that stores that actual TODO data, 
which back end users retrieve from
